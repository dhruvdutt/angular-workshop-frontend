## Angular.js Workshop

Front-end for the hands on with angular.js workshop conducted by [@dhruvdutt](https://github.com/dhruvdutt) & [me](https://github.com/dhwanilvyas) at Changa University.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/dhwanilvyas/angular-workshop-frontend && cd angular-workshop-frontend`
2. Use any http server to run the site. I use **live-server**. You can get it by running `npm install -g live-server` and then simply run `live-server`.
