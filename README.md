## Angular.js Workshop

Front-end for the hands on with angular.js workshop.

#### Installation

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/dhwanilvyas/angular-workshop-frontend && cd angular-workshop-frontend`
2. Use any http server to run the site. I use **live-server**. You can get it by running `npm install -g live-server` and then simply run `live-server`.
